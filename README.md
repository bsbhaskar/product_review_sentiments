# Product Insights Based On Customer Reviews
Analyzes Consumer Reviews to gain actionable insights on any given Product. The project uses three models - Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes Classifier, Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Word2Vec to identify key features within positive and negative reviews, cluster them into topics and find relationship between features, respectively. Selenium and Beautiful Soup is used to scrape and parse reviews and Natural Language Processing Pipeline vectorizes raw scraped text into TFIDF for analysis. Spacy and Gensim is used identify entities, phrases and sentiments.

Product owners interested in understanding what their customers are saying about their product can use this codebase
to scrape online e-commerce sites, vectorize words and highlight key features.
